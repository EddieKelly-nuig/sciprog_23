This source code demonstrates how pointers, arrays and memory interact
within the C programming language. The source code demonstrates how 
memory for an array can be allocated of a user defined length,
said memory intialized with some integer value (namely 1 in this example)
and the stored array be printed. This source code can demonstrate how
functions can accept pointers as valid arguments.

In order to compile this source code please use the following command.

gcc -o pointers pointers.c -lm

Upon sucessful execution, the user will be asked to enter an integer 
which corresponds to the desired length of the array. An array filled
with the integers 1 of the  The size of the array stored in memory will
 then be printed. A print statement checking whether the 3rd element of 
 the array is 1 as it should be.
