This code is used to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers. An
iterative approach based on Euclidean division and a recursive approach are us-
ed to calculate the greatest common divisors. The function accepts two integers
x,y as inputs and returns their greatest common divisor using both approaches -
above.

In order to compile this source code please use the following command.

gcc -o gcd gcd.c -lm

The scipt upon execution will ask the user to enter these two integers. 
The greatest common divisor from both approaches will be printed as well as a 
statement indicating whether the two integers are comprime or not.
