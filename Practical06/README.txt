This source code demonstrates how matrix multiplication of two matrices A, B to produce a
third matrix C can be acheieved by using nested loops. The two matrices A, B  are defined 
elementwise and the third matrix C is defined to be all zeroes. 

---

In order to compile this source code, please use the following command:

gcc -o matrixmul matrixmul.c -lm

---

Upon successful execution of the code, the three matrices A, B and C should be printed
with C equaling the matrix product of A.B .
